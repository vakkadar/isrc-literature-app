# Usage limits (Cursor + terminal)

## Terminal (Cursor or PyCharm)

| Report | Command | Needs |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Repo context vs raw** | `ai-dev-exp cursor-context` / `--brief` / `--format json` | `codex-tree` on `PATH`, `.codex-tree/` |

Run from **Cursor’s integrated terminal** or **PyCharm’s terminal** with working directory = git root.

**PyCharm External Tools:** Program `ai-dev-exp`, arguments e.g. `cursor-context --brief`.

## Cursor plan / Composer

**Subscription and quota** are only in **Cursor Settings** (billing / usage). No CLI in this bundle reads them.

**Open the account page from the terminal:** from the **ai-dev-exp** repo root, `bash scripts/open-cursor-usage.sh` (public URL only; no credentials in the script). In Cursor, the **`usage-status`** command (`.cursor/commands/usage-status.md`) tells the agent to run that script.

## When the user asks for numbers

- **Cursor billing** → Cursor Settings.
- **Repo context strategy** → `cursor-context` in terminal.
